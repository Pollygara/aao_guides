## AAO Guides for MSFS 2020 

Aircraft mods for MSFS 2020 usually uses custom LVars and HVars for certain functions. These variables cannot be assigned inside sim so 3rd party software must be used. Here you can find guides how to setup Lorby-SI’s Axis and Ohs with few aircraft mods. I have used Honeycomb Bravo in examples but any supported peripheral can be used.  

### Software needed 

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 
- [Lorby-SI Axis and Oh's](https://axisandohs.weebly.com/) 
- Your favorite aircraft mod *(WT CJ4, FBW 320neo)*
